## Storage 

Azure Blob Storage is a form of object storage created on behalf of Microsoft that has features like seamless scalability, optimization for data lakes, and comprehensive data mangement. Azure Blob Storage is often used for cloud-native workloads, archives, data lakes, high performance computing, and machine learning. Because of the multiple storage tiers and automated life cycle management of this specific type of storage, petabytes of data can be stored. Python can then be integrated in Azure Blob Storage to help manage the blobs and containers. Then, blobs can be uploaded to the containers. With Python, a user can list, download, and upload blobs, as well as create and delete containers.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Block Volumes is a form of virtual machine disk storage created on behalf of Oracle. Features of OCI Block Volume include advanced block storage, elastic performance flexibility, high availbility with integrated backup, disaster recovery & business continuity, scalable & secure cloud storage, and better storage price-performance. Oracle highlights that this specific type of storage can handle multiple tiers and can reduce the amount customers are paying based on their daily performance needs. Some examples of Python being used in this storage is to encrypt file streams & strings, manage content, perform database migration, etc. 

## Compute

AWS Amplify is a shared web hosting service that hosts modern web apps. Some features of AWS Amplify are full stack CI / CD workflows, pull request previews, easy custom domains, monitoring, redirects & custom headers, and password protection. Under AWS Amplify, users can connect their repositories where they can then configure build settings for the front end and back end of their app, and lastly deploy the app to a content delivery network (CDN). Python can be used in this service as an Application Programming Interface (API).

Amazon EC2 is a virtual server service that has a secure and resizable compute capacity. A virtual server is defined as a server that is located in the cloud or an offsite data center that shares hardware and software resources with other virtual servers. Amazon EC2 can be used to run cloud-native & enterprise applications, scale for high performance computing (HPC) applications, develop for Apple platforms, and train & deploy machine learning applications. AWS SDK for Python can be used with Amazon EC2. Additionally, Python scripts can be run in Amazon EC2. 

## Database Services

Azure SQL Database is a relational database management service powered by Microsoft that builds apps on a fully managed SQL database. A relational database management system is a collection of programs that allows IT teams to create, update, and administer relational databases. Features of Azure SQL Database are a fully managed database engine, flexible & responsive serveless compute, layers of protections, and built in AI. Python can be used to connect to and query Azure SQL Database. 

Amazon Timestream is a timeseries database service that can store and analyze trillions of events per day at a faster rate. A time series database is a database that is optimized for time stamped and time series data. Features of Amazon Timestream include quickly analyzing time series data using SQL, simplifying data lifecycle management with storage tiers, and making business decisions at a frsction of the cost of existing time-series solutions. Amazon Timestream can be used in IoT applications, DevOps applications, and analytics applications. Python can be used to write data into the Amazon Timestream database & Python SDK can be used with Amazon Timestream.
