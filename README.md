## Storage 

Azure Blob Storage is a form of object storage created on behalf of Microsoft that has features like seamless scalability, optimization for data lakes, and comprehensive data mangement. Azure Blob Storage is often used for cloud-native workloads, archives, data lakes, high performance computing, and machine learning. Because of the multiple storage tiers and automated life cycle management of this specific type of storage, petabytes of data can be stored. Python can then be integrated in Azure Blob Storage to help manage the blobs and containers. Then, blobs can be uploaded to the containers. With Python, a user can list, download, and upload blobs, as well as create and delete containers.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Block Volumes is a form of virtual machine disk storage created on behalf of Oracle. Features of OCI Block Volume include advanced block storage, elastic performance flexibility, high availbility with integrated backup, disaster recovery & business continuity, scalable & secure cloud storage, and better storage price-performance. Oracle highlights that this specific type of storage can handle multiple tiers and can reduce the amount customers are paying based on their daily performance needs. Some examples of Python being used in this storage is to encrypt file streams & strings, manage content, perform database migration, etc.
